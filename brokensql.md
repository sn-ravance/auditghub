I see the terminal output shows the setup script is running but seems to be stuck or taking a long time during the build process. Let me help analyze what's happening.

From the output, I can see:

The script is setting up the portal stack with AI profile (ollama) enabled
It's pulling Docker images (postgrest, db, ollama)
It's building some containers but appears to be hanging
Let me check the status of the Docker containers to see what's running:

~/…/GitHub/auditgh$ docker ps -a

Exit Code 0

I can see that while the portal-ollama-1 container is running, the database container (portal-db-1) has exited with an error code 3. This is likely why the setup appears to be stuck.

Let's check the logs for the database container to see what's causing the failure:

~/…/GitHub/auditgh$ docker logs portal-db-1

I found the issue. The database initialization is failing because the postgrest_service role doesn't exist when the script tries to create a policy for it. This is happening in the 014_ai_tokens.sql file.

Let's fix this by:

First, let's clean up the existing containers:
~/…/GitHub/auditgh$ docker-compose down


Let's check the database initialization scripts to see where we need to add the missing role. I'll look for the SQL files that might contain role definitions:

Let's check the RLS (Row Level Security) file since it's likely where the roles are defined:

I found the issue. The postgrest_service role is missing, but it's being referenced in the 
014_ai_tokens.sql
 file. Let's check that file to see how it's being used:

I'll fix this by adding the missing postgrest_service role creation to the RLS file. Here's what I'll do:

004_rls.sql
+3
Let's also grant the necessary permissions to the postgrest_service role to ensure it has the required access:

004_rls.sql
+3
-3
Let's try running the setup script again to see if our changes resolved the issue:

~/…/GitHub/auditgh$ ./setup.sh

I've initiated the setup script again. Here's what I did to fix the issue:

Added the missing postgrest_service role creation in the RLS (Row Level Security) initialization script
Granted the necessary permissions to the postgrest_service role
Ensured the role is created before it's referenced in other scripts
The script is now running in the background. The previous error should be resolved since we've added the missing role that was causing the database initialization to fail.

The setup process might take a few minutes to complete. Once it's done, you should have a working instance of the application with all the necessary database roles and permissions properly configured.

Would you like me to check the status of the setup process after a few moments?

I found the issue. The error is in the

Let's fix this by updating the view definition:

I've made the following changes to fix the database initialization issues:

Fixed the view definitions in

 to use p.id instead of the non-existent p.uuid column
Added the missing postgrest_service role creation in 
004_rls.sql
Added proper permissions for the postgrest_service role
The setup script is now running again. The previous error about the missing uuid column should be resolved. The script will:

Tear down any existing containers and volumes
Rebuild and restart all services with the corrected configurations
The setup might take a few minutes to complete. Once it's done, the application should start up correctly with all the necessary database tables, views, and permissions properly configured.

Would you like me to check the status of the setup process after a few moments?

I found the issue. The script is trying to grant permissions to a postgrest_admin role that doesn't exist. Let's fix this by adding the missing role to the RLS file, similar to what we did for the postgrest_service role:

Let's clean up and restart the setup process with the new changes:

I've made the following changes to fix the database initialization:

Added the missing postgrest_admin role creation in the RLS file
Granted the necessary permissions to the postgrest_admin role
Ensured all required roles are created before they're referenced in other scripts
The setup script is now running again. The previous error about the missing postgrest_admin role should be resolved. The script will:

Tear down any existing containers and volumes
Rebuild and restart all services with the corrected configurations
The setup might take a few minutes to complete. Once it's done, the application should start up correctly with all the necessary database roles, tables, views, and permissions properly configured.

Would you like me to check the status of the setup process after a few moments?

I see the issue. The error is related to the Redis session store configuration. The error suggests there's a problem with how the Redis store is being initialized in the session configuration.

Let's check the session configuration file:

I found the issue. The error is due to a breaking change in the connect-redis package. The way we're initializing the Redis store needs to be updated. Let's fix the session configuration:

Let's give Docker a moment to start up, and then we'll try running the services again.

Great! The server is now running successfully. Let's verify that all services are up and running:

~/…/GitHub/auditgh$ docker ps


Great news! The application is now up and running. Here's a quick summary of what we accomplished:

Fixed Database Initialization:
Added missing roles (postgrest_service and postgrest_admin)
Fixed view definitions in the database schema
Ensured proper permissions for all roles
Resolved Redis Session Store Issues:
Updated the Redis store initialization to work with the latest connect-redis version
Added proper error handling for Redis connections
Ensured the session configuration is compatible with the application
Fixed Port Conflicts:
Resolved port conflicts by stopping conflicting processes
Ensured all services start correctly
Verified Services:
Confirmed that all containers are running:
auditgh-server-1 (Node.js application)
auditgh-db-1 (PostgreSQL database)
portal-ollama-1 (Ollama service)
The application should now be accessible at:

Web interface: http://localhost:5173
API server: http://localhost:8080
Database: localhost:5434
If you need to access any specific service or run into any other issues, feel free to ask!
